# League Rune Reminder LoL

** IMPORTANT **

On first download, please double-click on the AutoRuneReminder program to open it. This is a one time occurence. After this, the program will automatically open on startup and will run as intended.

Just double clicking will run the program, the official release and onwards will not open and display a terminal screen but will run in your background

If you were to move the program around, please double click the .exe file after you placed it in a new destination, this will then update the target of your shortcut.

If you wish to uninstall the program, just delete the program and delete the shortcut located in the startup folder
