# League Rune Reminder LoL

** IMPORTANT **

On first download, please double-click on the AutoRuneReminder program to open it. This is a one time occurence. After this, the program will automatically open on startup and will run as intended.

Just double clicking will run the program, the official release and onwards will not open and display a terminal screen but will run in your background

If you were to move the program around, please double click the .exe file after you placed it in a new destination, this will then update the target of your shortcut.

Also when moving the program around, also move config.json file along with it and keep it in the SAME folder as the .exe

If you wish to uninstall the program, just delete the program and delete the shortcut located in the startup folder along with config.json file

To do this, you will first need to go into settings.exe and press down on Break Program and pressing save. This will stop the program from running and allow you to uninstall

***THIS PROGRAM ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS*** Tested only on windows 10

# How the Program works:

The program when you first run it will create a shortcut in your startup menu, this in turn will start your program everytime you boot your computer
(this uses 1% of your computer proccessing power *tested on potato* )

The program then searches for your league download location and will then actively detect if your client is open

When client is open, it will then search for champ select and move into the next stage

When in champ select, on loadout screen (right after picking champs) it will warn/remind you to change your runes

Then the loop will repeat

*I might also intergrate and auto-accepter in later version as an option*

**SETTINGS**

This program also comes with a program called settings.exe which is a new graphic user interface to help streamline your settings (Changes were done directly to config.json in version before v1.4 which wasnt very user friendly)
If in need of help of any of the functionalities, please visit the help section on the top left corner in settings.exe under the file section

SETTINGS.EXE IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE WITH ANY VERSIONS UNDER V1.4 PLEASE REFER TO THE COMMENTS WITHIN THE CONFIG.JSON FILE FOR 1.3 AND BELOW (edit through notepad)

DO NOT DELETE, TAMPER WITH, RELOCATE INDIVIUALLY, OR RENAME config.json file as you will lose your current settings
